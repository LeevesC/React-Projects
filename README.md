# React-Projects
This repository is for learning React. Thanks to Jonas (https://codingheroes.io/), the project materials in this repository are sourced from his excellent React course. After studying with Jonas, I independently recreated these web applications using React to strengthen my understanding and coding skills.

## 02_travel list
- Always adding id for each piece of data, when handle data.
- Using destructuring to shallow copy an array like data, when handling an attribute of data through state(React feature).

## 03_eat-and-split
- If you want to control the visibility of an element, control it from its parent element, not inside of it.
  - When the element hidden, we hope values in it could be reset. Easy to implement through state from its parent.

## 05_React-Quiz
- Using useReducer to control the complex states.
- Combining useReducer and createContext to manage states effectively.

## 06_WorldWide
- Using React Router to implement SPA(Singl-Page-Application).
- Operations on the map, display cities and countries from local data.
- Using useContext to control the authentication, but a issue ocurred on map.
